# Flutter PATH Configuration
# Copy this file to ~/.zshrc or add these lines to your existing ~/.zshrc

# If Flutter is installed, uncomment and update the path below
# Common Flutter installation locations:
# - ~/flutter (if downloaded manually)
# - ~/development/flutter
# - /usr/local/flutter

# Uncomment the line that matches your Flutter installation location:
# export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/flutter/bin"
# export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/development/flutter/bin"
# export PATH="$PATH:/usr/local/flutter/bin"

# If Flutter is installed via Homebrew, it should already be in PATH
# Verify with: which flutter

# export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/emulator
# export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools
